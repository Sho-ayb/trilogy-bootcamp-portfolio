## Unit 2 Challenge: Creating a Portfolio Page

## Introduction

This is my portfolio webpage as part of attending the Trilogy Bootcamp in Full Front End Web Development. This is part of Unit 2 Challenge in creating a portfolio page which will be assessed according to the following acceptance criteria.

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Objectives

As part of the bootcamp challenge, I will be meeting the acceptance criteria advised above. The portfolio webpage will need to be structured and designed similar to the mockup provided with this challenge but can be styled differently with the following:

- color of font and background
- images
- typography
- number of project links

The following is a animated image of what the portfolio page should generally look like.
